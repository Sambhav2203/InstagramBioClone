The App has a very simple and interactive ui which make it easier to understand the flow of the app. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app :
Diffrent screen layouts : The project employs a variety of layouts, each of which provides unique functionality and aids in the UI's ability to work across a wide range of screen sizes (Example : Linear Layout, Constraint Layout, Frame Layout).
Recyclerview : We selected recycler view to exhibit the list of distinct notes because it efficiently displays a large number of things..
MVC Architecture : We adopted the MVC design, which improves code testability and makes it easier to add new features by emphasising the separation of concerns.
LiveData & Room Database : We are using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the notes and update it to local databases using Room.
